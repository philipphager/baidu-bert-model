# MonoBERT models for Baidu-ULTR
This repository contains code to train flax-based MonoBERT ranking models from scratch for the large-scale Baidu-ULTR search dataset. The repository is part of a [larger reproducibility study](https://philipphager.github.io/assets/papers/2024-sigir-ultr-meets-reality.pdf) of unbiased learning-to-rank methods on the Baidu-ULTR datasets.
